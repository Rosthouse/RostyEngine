RostyEngine
===========

An Engine based on [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), purely for me to get back into gamedev. Have waited long enough.

In this engine, I try to use current Game Design Patterns. This means the engine is heavily using the [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), provided by the [Ashley Library](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley).

The engine can natively read [Tiled Maps](http://www.mapeditor.org/), although some restrictions apply, which are noted on the project wiki.

For physics the engine uses the [Box2D](http://box2d.org/) engine, provided by LibGDX itself.
